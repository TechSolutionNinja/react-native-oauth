## react-native-oauth

The `react-native-oauth` library provides an interface to OAuth 1.0 and OAuth 2.0 providers, such as [Twitter](http://twitter.com) and [Facebook](http://facebook.com) to React native.

## TL;DR;

This library cuts out the muck of dealing with the [OAuth 1.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849) and [OAuth 2.0](http://oauth.net/2/) protocols in react-native apps. The API is incredibly simple and straight-forward and is intended on getting you up and running quickly with OAuth providers (such as Facebook, Github, Twitter, etc).
